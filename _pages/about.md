I am an PhD student in the institute of child and adolescent, Peking University, and a visiting researcher in the Centre for Adolescent Health, Murdoch Children’s Research Institute.

Research Interests
-----------
My research interests primarily focus on disease burden among children and adolescents. By utilizing open-source data, such as that from the Global Burden of Disease, I explore changes in disease patterns and inequalities across different regions, genders, and age groups.
